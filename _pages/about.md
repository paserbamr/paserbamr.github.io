I am a dedicated researcher and leader currently pursuing a PhD in Biomedical Engineering at the University of Michigan, advised by Dr. Deepak Nagrath. I completed my BS/MS at Case Western Reserve University under Dr. Thomas Gerken. My technical expertise includes mass spectrometry, metabolomics, flow cytometry, and primary immune cell culture techniques. Beyond my research, I am passionate about mentorship, leadership, and fostering inclusive scientific communities. I serve as the co-director of the Graduate Society of Women Engineers (GradSWE) at the University of Michigan, where I lead a team of officers, coordinate professional development initiatives, and support the next generation of engineers and scientists.
